        Biography
    </h2>
    <p2>
        Larry Wheels grew up in Bronx, New York. While today, he lives a life full of success and recognition, his childhood was completely different. Larry grew up in poor neighborhoods of New York, spent time in foster homes, and became familiar with hunger and poverty from an early age.
        On top of everything, Larry often had to face dangerous situations as a child, walking through the dark alleys and neighborhoods on his way to school. His initial motivation for strength training was that of safety. Larry wanted to look bigger and stronger so nobody would come near him.
